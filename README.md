## Overview

This project uses the following tech stack:
- Next.js 15 (for client framework)
- React 19 (for frontend components)
- Tailwind v4 (for styling)
- Shadcn UI (for UI components library)
- Lucide Icons (for icons)
- Convex (for backend & database)
- Framer Motion (for animations)

All relevant files live in the 'src' directory.

## Setup

This project is set up already and running on a cloud environment.

To set it up yourself:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server
4. Run `npx convex dev` to start the Convex development server

Running the convex development server is critical for ensuring the backend convex functions are correctly updating.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project can be deployed to GitHub Pages with the following steps:

1. Fork or push this repository to your GitHub account
2. Set up the following secret in your GitHub repository settings:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`: Your Convex deployment URL (from .env.local)
3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Set the source to 'GitHub Actions'
4. Push to the main branch or manually trigger the workflow
5. Your site will be deployed to `https://[your-username].github.io/kite-aggregator/`

**Note**: Since this is a static export, you'll need an active Convex deployment for the backend functionality to work.

## Environment Variables

The project is set up with project specific CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT and NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL environment variables on the client side.
